		<p>Drawing, painting, poetry, and collaging, are the mechanisms through which I generally choose to express myself and express how I perceive the world around me. In my artwork I see a glimpse of things that I had once seen before; things I had seen in the natural world, simply displayed through the different lens of visual art. <p/><p>Through my new found knowledge of  creating artwork through the digital world I continue to take from my experiences and create from these past interactions of the natural world. Digital art provides me with a platform to create in ways that not might be possible with more traditional mediums.  It gives me opportunities to express humanity in its many forms, and opportunities to take both the joy that comes with being human and the pain that comes with being human. <p/><p> I do not want to let any fragment of what it means to be human to be left behind, or underrepresented.  I want to create the imaginary and dream-like world that we as humans have as well. Creating is a part of my being.  My hope is that I not only represent humanity in its true form, but also stay true to myself.  After all, every artwork I create is, in some form, a self-portrait; it shares a little bit of information about myself and how I view the world that surrounds me.</p>
